

1-Suppose the following part of module of auth service

-The auth module is responsible for authenticate incoming requests and validate the user credentials and also token.
-The auth module implemented in more than one part one to mange requests from user and the other is to mange checking credintials with database.

Implement the previous part using SOLID principle
Assume any missing data.



2-Assume the following part of shipment module 

When a shipper wants to place a shipment he will choose shipment will be ship using Playground or Air and the customer gives you some requirements that he may add overseas in the future.
Each shipment has pickup date , delivery date , commodities , ship from and ship to.

Implement the previous part using SOLID principle
Assume any missing data.


3-Assume that we implement the part of checking that user has specific role or not.
If the user has the specifid role the function return true else return false.

Each user has array of roles and we want to implement the logic so that the user roles array may maximized or minimized .


Implement the previous part using SOLID principle
Assume any missing data
